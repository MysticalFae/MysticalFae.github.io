Ideas for Project --

1. Book log
users can input a new book (title, author, and rating)
and, they can access said book through the title (or maybe a code).
User can print out all the book titles along with their code as a reference
And maybe the books can be accessed by each "identifier" (i.e. their title, the author, their rating)
Like the user can sort by rating or by author or by title
or, they can pull out certain book logs that contain specific info (ex. only books w/ 5 stars)
and maybe there's an option while they're logging their book that allows them to briefly write their thoughts on it

    classes - 
    I feel like most of this could be achieved with a single class called "book" but...
    1. Maybe a class for adding/changing info on books 
    Methods :
        newBook(title, author, rating)
        newBook(title, author, rating, thoughts)
        remove(title)
        change(type, newValue)
    Attributes :
        title, author, rating, thoughts, code

    2. A class for retriving the info on the books
    Methods :
        find(bookTitle)
        find(bookCode)
        listAll()
        findAllWith(type, value)
    Attributes :
        none?
    3. And, maybe a parent class simply called "books" that deals with the simple/standard parts
    I don't really know what the methods/attributes would be for this one.. I guess I could take
    out the newBook methods in the first class and put them in this one? Seems sort of pointless though
